<h3>History</h3>
    <div class="col1">
        <p>The term was first used by the novelist Norman Mailer when he wrote ‘The Faith of graffiti ‘ in 1974's.
        Graffiti has a long history that dates back to the ancient Greeks and Romans. 
        These often had political slogans, love messages or popular quotes. The term is a collective name for decorated/plain text displayed on streets or public places that have been applied with some sort of paint or markers. 
        In the book Mailer writes about great artists like CAY 161 and LURK, trying to validate graffiti as an art form and not as vandalism.
