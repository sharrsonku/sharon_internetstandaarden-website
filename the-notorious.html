        <p>Graffiti as we know it now started in the 1970s when New York youth started leaving their names </p>   
        <p>on trains, buildings and so on. These are called tags which you will read more about in <a href="Styles.html">styles.</a> </p>
        <p>What once was a subculture has now gained recognition as a significant art movement.</p>

        <h2>Darryl McCray</h2>
        <p>Also known as CornBread, is the first graffiti artist. During the mid-1960s, 12-year old Darryl tagged his nickname 'CornBread' on the walls of The Philedelphia Youth Development Center. 
        A few years after his release he and his friends took his art to the streets. <q> The more they talked, the more i wrote.</q>  
        When a newspaper article was published stating that CornBread was shot dead he needed to snap the publics attention to denote that he was still alive.
        He decided to spray his name on a live animal in the Philedelphia zoo and got arrested trying to leave the zoo. 
        This earned him so much more notoriety that believe it or not even police officers were asking him for his autograph.</p>

        <h2>BlekLekRat</h2>
        <p>Real name Xavier Prou ,also known as The father of stencil graffiti, is a French artist who painted images of rats.  
         The rats symbolised marginalised citizens and the urban environment he lived in. 
         Because of this he spreads his art all over Paris, like a plague.  
         After being arrested in 1991 he turned to pre stencil to make it quicker to paint, less likely to get caught again.
         Today Blek is credited as the one to invent life-sized stencils and the first to transform stencil from just plain lettering into imagery.
         However he only started to get accepted and recognition around 2005. 
         According to Blek this is thanks to Banksy.</p>
